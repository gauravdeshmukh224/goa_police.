    <p>
        The Goa Police as an independent organisation was established in April 1946 with the formation of
        Policia do Estado da India (PEI) under the Portuguese regime. Before this, all policing functions,
        including maintenance of law and order, were carried out by the Portuguese military.
    </p>

    <p>
        The PEI was responsible for vigilance and maintaining public order. It consisted of branches such as
        Public Security, Judicial Police, Traffic Police, Administrative & Municipal Police, and Civil Identification.
    </p>

    <p>
        Initially, PEI functioned under regulations of O Corpo de Policia e Fiscalizacao da India (CPFI),
        created in 1924 as the policing arm of the military. The police operated under CPFI command supervision.
    </p>

    <p>
        The PEI was divided into five territorial divisions, each headed by a commissioner.
        It held extensive powers including search, seizure, prosecution, and extradition proceedings.
    </p>

    <p>
        The strength of PEI grew significantly, particularly due to the rising freedom movement in Goa,
        notably influenced by Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia’s civil disobedience movement in 1946.
        Over time, the PEI became known for strict enforcement during the Portuguese regime.

            <p>
                After Liberation, Goa Police underwent major restructuring. N R Nagu became the first

            <h3>1966 – Structural Reforms</h3>
            <p>
                Major reforms were implemented following recommendations of B Shetty,
                Additional DGP in CBI, based on his 1965 study of the police system.
                These reforms laid the foundation of modern Goa Police.

            </p>

    <p>
