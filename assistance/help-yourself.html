    <p>
        In several cases, citizens are unwilling to disclose information on locally witnessed crime incidents or accidents 
        in fear of reprisals at the hands of criminal elements or the persons involved or in order to avoid attending courts etc. 
        Sometimes there is information on very serious crime/accidents such as unauthorised weapons, narcotic drugs, explosives, 
        contraband etc., information about vehicles involved in accidents and many times description and identity of the perpetrators of the crime.
        <span class="highlight">
        Citizens are bound by law to convey such information to the Police. Please cooperate by kindly passing on such information 
        to the Police immediately since delay can be fatal.
        </span>
    </p>

    <p>
        It may be remembered that every Citizen is a policeman without uniform and every Policeman is a citizen in uniform. 
        Participation of members of public in police working is very important as it does not only help police but ultimately 
        helps the public only.
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">How People Can Help Police</div>

    <div class="info-box">
        <strong>1. In Investigation of Crime:</strong>  
        In investigation people can pass on valuable information to police regarding:
        <ul>
            <li>Description of the accused/suspects</li>
            <li>Number and description of vehicle involved and direction after crime</li>
            <li>Vehicle abandoned in a public place for long time</li>
            <li>Weapons</li>
            <li>Explosives</li>
            <li>Contrabands</li>
            <li>Narcotic drugs</li>
            <li>Suspicious movements of strangers or known people</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Members of public are advised not to handle anything or disturb the scene of offense till arrival of police,
            which helps in collecting valuable evidence against the offender.
        </p>

        <div class="helpline">
            Citizens can call helpline number <span>112</span> and report any information in complete anonymity.
            The caller may give a fictitious birth date or identity number as a code for identification for follow-ups
            and possible rewards.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="info-box">
        <strong>2. In Prevention of Crime:</strong>  
        Members of public can also play a major role in prevention of crime.  
        Taking safety precautions in one's own interest amounts to a major contribution.  
        Important safety tips should be followed in day-to-day life to ensure safety of community.
