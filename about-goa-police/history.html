<div class="container">

<!-- Pre 1961 -->
<div class="section">
    <h2>Pre 1961</h2>

    <p>
    The Goa Police as an independent organisation was born in April 1946 with the establishment of <strong>Policia do Estado da India (PEI)</strong> – Police of India, through a decree of the Portuguese regime which ruled Goa until 1961. Until then, all policing functions including the maintenance of law and order were being carried out by the Portuguese military.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
        The PEI was responsible for vigilance and maintenance of general order and comprised the following branches:
        <ul>
            <li>Public Security</li>
            <li>Judicial Police</li>
            <li>Internal and External Traffic Police</li>
            <li>Administrative & Municipal Police</li>
            <li>Civil Identifications</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
    Two years later, appropriate rules governing the police were framed on the lines of the legislation then prevailing in Portugal. During this period, the PEI functioned under the regulations of <strong>O Corpo de Policia e Fiscalizacao da India (CPFI)</strong> – The Corps of Police and Inspection Services of India, established in 1924 to function as the policing arm of the military.
    </p>

    <p>
    The PEI was organized into five territorial divisions, each headed by a commissioner reporting to the commander of the PEI. It developed into a supreme law and order establishment with powers to conduct search and seizure operations, frame proceedings for prosecution, and file extradition cases.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Punishment & Rewards System:</strong><br>
        Punishments included admonishment, censure, fines, detention upto 130 days, imprisonment upto 30 days, reversion, compulsory retirement and dismissal.<br><br>
        Rewards included exemption from service upto 12 days, leave with salary upto 30 days and pecuniary benefits upto 30 days’ pay.
    </div>

    <p>
    The strength of the PEI grew steadily, largely due to the Portuguese regime’s efforts to contain the rising freedom movement in Goa. A major boost to the movement came from Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia’s civil disobedience movement in 1946. Over time, the PEI, once respected for efficient policing, became notorious for brutal repression of the freedom struggle.
    </p>

<!-- Years of Change -->

    <h2>Years of Change: 1961 – 1965</h2>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <p>
            With Liberation and the departure of the Portuguese, a complete reorganization of the Goa Police began. <strong>N R Nagu</strong> became the first Inspector General of Police (IGP) of free Goa.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <p>
            Officers serving in the PEI were accommodated in the new Goa Police. Those wishing to leave were relieved from February 1, 1962. Initially, the PEI structure was retained before gradually being aligned with Indian policing systems and laws.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <p>
            In 1966, major reforms were introduced following recommendations by <strong>B Shetty, Additional DGP in CBI</strong>, after studying the police setup in 1965. His recommendations addressed structural gaps and public distrust.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <p>
            The Goa Police was headed by an Inspector General of Police until 2nd February 1999.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <p>
            Over the years, Goa Police has transformed significantly in both functioning and public image. It continues striving to be a people-friendly force that law-abiding citizens need not fear.
